        <h3>What is this about?</h3>
        <p>Much like a big company, I take my core values seriously. They guide my work and life decisions so I can rest at ease knowing I'm doing my best and improving every day</p>
        <p>Here you will find a brief overview of my core values, as well as some anecdotes that illustrate their importance in my life. Be aware that I do not consider myself proficient in philosophy, but you may find some references to Aristotle and Socrates, as they have had a significant influence on my thinking.</p>

            <p class="card-description">Yes, this is the very first value I hold dear. Honesty is the foundation of any meaningful relationship, be it personal or professional. I strive to be transparent in my actions and words, and I encourage my students and teammates to do the same.</p>

            <p class="card-description">Throughout my life, it has been very difficult to be courageous. However, when I have faced my fears head-on, the rewards have been immense.

            <p class="card-description">Nowadays, people are exposed to overwhelming amounts of violence and negativity. Whether it's through the news, social media, or even in their personal lives, it's easy to become desensitized or mean. By being kind to others, I have created a shield that protects me from the negativity directed at me.</p>

            <h4>My First Students</h4><button type="button" onclick="showMore(this)"><img src="images/show-more.png" alt="Show more icon"></button>
            <p>Starting my career as a private English tutor required significant courage. While working as an intern at a language school, I was assigned to assess two newly enrolled students. Upon reviewing their evaluation results, I identified substantial gaps in their English proficiency. Recognizing an opportunity to make a meaningful impact, I approached their mother and professionally presented my observations along with a proposal to provide private tutoring. She accepted, marking the beginning of my journey as an independent educator.</p>

            <p>A student once approached me expressing frustration with their lack of progress. Rather than offering empty reassurances, I chose honesty. We had a candid conversation about their strengths and specific areas requiring improvement, along with actionable steps forward. This transparent approach built genuine trust between us, and the student later thanked me for the constructive feedback that ultimately led to remarkable advancement in their language skills.</p>

            <h4>Grateful for Mentorship</h4><button type="button" onclick="showMore(this)"><img src="images/show-more.png" alt="Show more icon"></button>
            <p>Early in my teaching career, a senior colleague took time from their busy schedule to mentor me through challenging classroom situations. Their guidance proved invaluable in shaping my teaching methodology. This experience taught me the importance of gratitude and paying it forward. Now, I make it a priority to support newer educators, remembering how transformative that mentorship was for my professional development.</p>

            <h4>Kindness During Difficult Times</h4><button type="button" onclick="showMore(this)"><img src="images/show-more.png" alt="Show more icon"></button>
            <p>One of my students was going through a particularly difficult period, struggling with personal issues that affected their academic performance. Instead of enforcing strict deadlines, I showed understanding and flexibility, adjusting their workload while maintaining educational standards. This act of kindness not only helped them through a tough time but also strengthened our teacher-student relationship, demonstrating that compassion and professionalism can coexist effectively.</p>

            <h4>Courage to Pivot Careers</h4><button type="button" onclick="showMore(this)"><img src="images/show-more.png" alt="Show more icon"></button>
            <p>Transitioning from education to software development was one of the most courageous decisions of my life. Despite having established myself as an English teacher, I recognized my passion for technology and programming. Leaving the security of a familiar career path to pursue something entirely new required confronting deep fears of failure and uncertainty. However, that leap of faith has led to tremendous personal and professional growth, proving that courage often opens doors to unexpected opportunities.</p>
