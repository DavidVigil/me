        <p>Much like successful organizations, I take my core values seriously. They serve as guiding principles for my work and life decisions, helping me strive for continuous improvement and personal growth.</p>
        <p>Below you'll find my four core values—Honesty, Courage, Gratitude, and Kindness—each accompanied by meaningful quotes and personal reflections. You'll also discover stories that illustrate how these values have shaped my journey and influenced important decisions throughout my life.</p>

            <p class="card-description">Yes, this is the very first value I hold dear. Honesty is the foundation of any meaningful relationship, be it personal or professional. I strive to be transparent in my actions and words, and I encourage my students and teammates to do the same.</p>

            <p class="card-description">Throughout my life, it has been very difficult to be courageous. However, when I have faced my fears head-on, the rewards have been immense.

            <p class="card-description">Nowadays, people are exposed to overwhelming amounts of violence and negativity. Whether it's through the news, social media, or even in their personal lives, it's easy to become desensitized or mean. By being kind to others, I have created a shield that protects me from the negativity directed at me.</p>

            <h4>Taking the Leap: My First Private Students</h4><button type="button" onclick="showMore(this)"><img src="images/show-more.png" alt="Show more icon"></button>
            <p>Starting my career as a private English tutor was a defining moment of courage. While interning at an elementary bilingual school, I was tasked with assessing two newly enrolled students. After reviewing their evaluations, I noticed significant gaps in their English proficiency. I saw an opportunity to make a real difference, but it required stepping outside my comfort zone. I approached their mother, presented my observations professionally, and offered to provide private tutoring. She accepted, and that decision marked the beginning of my journey as an independent educator—a journey I wouldn't have embarked on without facing my fears.</p>

            <h4>Choosing Kindness Over Revenge</h4><button type="button" onclick="showMore(this)"><img src="images/show-more.png" alt="Show more icon"></button>
            <p>During a group project, two teammates submitted our assignment early without including my name, as I hadn't been able to contribute yet. I felt wronged and, unfortunately, chose retaliation. In the next team evaluation, I rushed to complete the work with another teammate and deliberately excluded the third member's name from the submission. He had to retake the course. Initially, I felt vindicated, but reflection brought shame. When another opportunity for revenge arose with the second teammate who had wronged me, I stopped myself. I realized that deriving satisfaction from others' suffering was poisoning my character. I asked the teacher to reassign him to another team, honestly explaining my struggle with resentment. She agreed and advised me not to harbor such destructive emotions. I'm grateful I changed course, though I deeply regret the harm I caused the first student. This experience taught me that kindness isn't just about others—it's about protecting your own integrity.</p>

            <h4>Trust and Gratitude in Team Challenges</h4><button type="button" onclick="showMore(this)"><img src="images/show-more.png" alt="Show more icon"></button>
            <p>In one of my courses, I had accumulated significant extra credit points. However, our final project carried substantial weight in the overall grade. My two teammates contributed nothing, leaving me to complete the entire project alone. Despite finishing it, the teammate responsible for submission failed to turn it in on time, putting all three of us at risk of failing. My extra points would have secured my passing grade individually. Instead, the teacher offered an option: sacrifice all my extra points in exchange for accepting a late submission with a maximum grade of 80%. I accepted, trusting in the quality of my work. The result gave both myself and one teammate a passing grade—I ended with the same score I would have achieved using my extra points alone, but I helped someone else succeed too. The teammate who failed was the same one who didn't submit the project. This experience reinforced my belief in helping others when possible and being grateful for the abilities that allow me to make a positive difference.</p>
